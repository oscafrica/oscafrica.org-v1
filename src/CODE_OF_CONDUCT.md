# Open Source Community Africa - Code of Conduct

When you become a chapter lead or member, you’re joining our diverse community which supports all spheres of technology. And like every growing community, we practice a few ground rules about expected behavior from everyone. These guidelines cover both online (e.g. mailing lists, social channels) and offline (e.g. in-person meetups) behavior.
Violations of this code of conduct can result:
* If at a meetup, to leave the meetup and its premises.
* Temporarily banned from the OSCA chatroom and/or O.S.C.A organization on github.
* Permanently banned from the OSCA chatroom and/or O.S.C.A organization on github.
* Permanently dropped as a chapter lead.
* members permanently removed from the O.S.C.A community. 

Always make use of your best judgement, and if you’d like more clarity or have questions feel free to reach out: info@oscafrica.org



## Community Guidelines and Anti-Harrasment policy:

### Members and Contributors Acknowledgement: 
* Respect: We're all part of the same community, be friendly, welcoming, and generally a nice person. All members of OSCA are expected to be of most polite manner when interacting with other members. treat others how you want to be treated,Be someone that other people want to be around.It’s all about “team effort”

* Considerate: All opinions matter, in some cases you would find yourself compromising and that is the team spirit. You are not a team because you work together, you are team because you trust, respect and care for each other.

* Patience: You would be working with a lot of people who are unique in their own way, patience is a virtue that would go a long way for comfort.

* Licensing: PLease adhere to licensing rules on any open source porject you get to work on under O.S.C.A. When writing an article for the OSCA blog page, do not advertise proprietary softwares or any product that is not open sourced.

* Collaboration: "The best teamwork comes from men who are working independently toward one goal in unison." – James Cash Penney. You are not generally expected to complete tasks alone, reach out and get other team members involved.

* Harassment: due to race, religion or gender,sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category is never welcome at O.S.C.A;
	- Speak up if you see or hear something- Harassment is NEVER tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or anyone is disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of their actions and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event or meetup organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event or meetup with no refund. If you are being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.
	- Harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category; sexual imagery in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; offensive verbal language; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. 

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

* Safety: At any offline OSCA meetups or events,  there shall be no weapons allowed, and no smoking on the premises.

* Be nice. Constructive. Be constructive with your communication to fellow members. Don't get into flamewars, make personal attacks, vent, or rant unconstructively. Everyone must take responsibility for the community and take the initiative to diffuse tension and stop a negative thread as early as possible.

* Participate. Join in on discussions, show up for in-person meetings regularly, offer feedback, and help implement that feedback.

* Step down considerately. If you have some form of responsibility in your community, be aware of your own constraints. If you know that a new job or personal situation will limit your time, find someone who can take over for you and transfer the relevant information (contacts, passwords, etc.) for a smooth transition.

* Basic etiquette for online discussions. Do not send messages to a big list that only need to go to one person. Keep off topic conversations to a minimum. Don’t be spammy by advertising or promoting personal projects which are off topic.
